# A* Algorithm Implementation in Java

## 📝 Description

This project implements the A* search algorithm to solve the Shortest Path Problem. It is a classical problem in AI and pathfinding, where the goal is to find the optimal path between a start point and an endpoint on a grid.

The implementation includes:
- **Heuristic function** using the Euclidean distance.
- **Open set management** using a priority queue.
- **Reconstruction of the path** once the final point is reached.

The project is intended to be used as a learning tool for understanding pathfinding algorithms.
